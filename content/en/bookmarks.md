These are some of the resources I found or stumbled upon on the internet throughout my life; most of the things here I personally found to be valuable and/or funny. I try to only add free web content here, so that you only need a web browser to access, no bs required. Enjoy! Hope you like it.

**[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) - Christoph Molnar**

Ever wonder which parameters, among thoundsands if not millions of parameters, have influence on your machine learning or deep learning models, and what do they stand for, what do they represent? Then this book is for you.

**[Novelty and Outlier Detection](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html) - Scikit Learn**

Found this while working on my bachelor's thesis, thanks to our professor, the topic was detecting hate speech on social media texts (comments, posts, etc.). The main problem? Turns out hate speech is not as common as we thought, they just happened to be loud. The skew in our dataset was like nine to one, and we were cherry-picking the data. A traditional classifier was simply ineffective on such a skewed dataset. So we tried this technique, and... it didn't work as well as we had hoped, but I still found this to be an interesting one. So here it is as a memento of those days.
